`react-native-dnd` is a modern and easy-to-use drag&drop library for react-native.

- **Modern and future-proof:** Built on [react-native-reanimated v3](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/)

- **Ready to use:** Out-of-the-box configurable components like [`Draggable`](./../components/draggable) to quickly get started.

- **Hooks based:** Exposes powerful hooks [`useDraggable`](./../hooks/usedraggable) and [`useDroppable`](./../hooks/usedroppable) to build your own primitive components.

- **Powerful & Performant:** The implementation has been tailored for advanced use cases where performance is critical. It can be used for a wide range of use cases like sorting.
